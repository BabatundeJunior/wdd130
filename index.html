            Hello! My name is Babatunde Junior and I am from Osun state, Nigeria. I am a student of <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">BYU</a>.

            in Information Tech. I enjoy tech related discussions and aspire to make a difference in the tech industry. I enjoy learning new
            things aswell. In my free time I play video games like Call Of Duty Mobile. My favourite book is eat that frog by Brian Tracy.
